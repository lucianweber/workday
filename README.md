# workday

[workday.netlify.app](https://workday.netlify.app)

Working from home on your thesis can be hard if you don't structure your day. This is why I started setting timers on my phone to pressure my self to deliver. It helped me to focus on my thesis work and led me to build this website, which shows a countdown on the remaining time you have to get stuff done for today.

It's a very basic page - all code in one file - and the only external dependency is font-awesome for a nice config-icon.
The fanciest part of the site is a small timeline (purely built with HTML Canvas) that visualizes the progression of time a bit different.

The start- and end-time of your workday as well as a break for lunch can be configured on the page itself, and your settings will be saved to localstorage.
